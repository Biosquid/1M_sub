extends Resource
class_name EntityStats
## Used as a container for modified runtime stats of an Entity.
##
## Use StatComponent to get a reference to the current stats on the Entity.
## We can increase these stats with buffs, items, or equipment. We shouldn't modify the stats
## directly, but instead create a modified version of the stats whenever we need them. This is so
## we don't have to worry about reverting the state of the stats whenever the buff/item/equipment
## is removed. See get_modified_stats on BuffBase for an example.
